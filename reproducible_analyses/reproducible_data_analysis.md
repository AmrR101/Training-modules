### Description

Recent reports in both the general and scientific media show there is increasing concern within the biomedical research community about the lack of reproducibility of key research findings. **Have you ever wondered how you could increase the reproducibility of your own work?**

Join us for a workshop on reproducible research, led by [Julie Goldman](https://scholar.harvard.edu/julie_goldman) from Countway Library Data Services. This session will provide some initial steps to take towards improving the planning, organization, and documentation of your research. Adopting a workflow that makes your results reproducible will ultimately make your life easier!
