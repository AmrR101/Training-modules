## Plotting in R

### Description
This repository has teaching materials for a **3 hour**, hands-on **Advanced visualization** workshop led at a moderate pace. The workshop will give participants an overview of the basics of the R package, ggplot2, for the generation of publication-worthy figures. Participants will also use several R packages (ggrepel, pheatmap, etc.) for learning how to change from a wide data format to a long data format for plotting purposes, how to label and/or repel individual data points on a scatter plot, and how to create heatmaps and volcano plots. 

### Learning Objectives

* **Creating basic plots**: Exploring and customizing basic plots (scatter plots, histograms, boxplots, etc.) using the ggplot2 package.
* **Exporting graphics**: Saving plots for use outside of the R environment.
* **Wrangling data for visualization**: Changing data formats for visualization purposes
* **Data assessment with volcano plots and heatmaps**: Learning how to create volcano plots and label interesting data points and how to create heatmaps with the pheatmap R package and interpret the output

> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but also amenable to self-guided learning.
