| Biologists | Beginner | None | 2 hour workshop (~2 hours of trainer-led time)|


### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a **2 hour**, hands-on **Introduction to the command line interface** workshop led at a relaxed pace. Many tools for the analysis of big data require knowledge of the command line, and this workshop will teach the basic skills needed to interact with the command line interface, specifically the bash shell. The lessons include learning the basic commands for interacting with your file directory and searching files. Specifically, you will learn commands for navigating the file system, exploring the contents of files, searching the contents of files, and performing basic file operations, such as moving, copying, and renaming files.

### Learning Objectives
*  **Using GO terms to explore enriched processes:** Determining how functions are attributed to genes using Gene Ontology terms
*  **Interpreting the results of enrichment tests:** Understanding the theory of how functional enrichment tools yield statistically enriched functions or interactions
*  **Descibing the different classes of functional analysis tools:** Discussing functional analysis using over-representation analysis, functional class scoring, and pathway topology methods
*  **Utilizing functional analysis tools to generate hypotheses regarding enriched processes/pathways:** Explore a variety of functional analysis tools

> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but also amenable to self-guided learning.
