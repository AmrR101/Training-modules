### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a **2 hour**, hands-on **Introduction to the command-line interface** workshop led at a relaxed pace. Many tools for the analysis of big data require knowledge of the command line, and this workshop will teach the basic skills needed to interact with the command-line interface, specifically the bash shell. The lessons include learning the basic commands for interacting with your file directory and searching files. Specifically, you will learn commands for navigating the file system, exploring the contents of files, searching the contents of files, and performing basic file operations, such as moving, copying, and renaming files.

### Learning Objectives

*  **Accessing the bash shell:** Understanding how to start up the command-line interface
*  **Navigating the file directory:** Recognizing the organization of the file directory and exploring the folders/files
*  **Performing file operations:** Understanding ways to manipulate files, such as moving, copying, and renaming files
*  **Exploring file contents:** Learning how to look at the contents of files
*  **Finding help:** Utilizing resources to determine how to specify desired commands
*  **Searching files:** Practicing searching for patterns within files
*  **Redirecting output:** Using redirection operators to create new files, append contents to an already existing file, and combining commands together

> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but also amenable to self-guided learning.
