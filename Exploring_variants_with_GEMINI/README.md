GEMINI is a tool that helps turn those giant, sparse VCF variant matrices (millions of rows, thousands of columns) into a simple, accessible database. Within the database GEMINI annotates with just about everything out there. ENCODE, OMIM, dbSNPâ€¦ plus internal annotations like regions of interest, candidate genes, etc. The resulting framework supports an interactive exploration of variant information in the context of numerous third-party genomic annotations.
