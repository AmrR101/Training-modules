| Biologists | Intermediate bash | Introduction to the command-line interface | 2 hour workshop (~2 hours of trainer-led time)|


### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a **2 hour**, hands-on **Intermediate bash** workshop led at a relaxed pace. Many tools for the analysis of big data require knowledge of the command line, and this workshop will build on the basic skills taught in the Introduction to the command-line interface workshop to allow for greater automation. This workshop will include lessons on how to use the command-line text editor, Vim, using for-loops for automation, introduction of variables, and writing scripts to perform a series of commands in a sequencial order. 

### Learning Objectives

* Learning basic operations using the Vim text editor
* Capturing previous commands into a script to re-run with one single command
* Understanding variables and storing information
* Learning how to use variables to operate on multiple files

> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but also amenable to self-guided learning.
